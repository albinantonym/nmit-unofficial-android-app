## Sections

➤ **NMIT Contineo**  
This section provides a faster, automated login to the Contineo portal, unlike the website which requires logging in every time. It also includes a quick odd/even portal switch. This section was implemented by analyzing and using the API endpoints from the college website.

➤ **Notes**  
This section contains notes shared by students. It can be especially useful for new students if maintained properly by the respective branch students. Currently, only the EEE branch is maintaining this section. It is implemented using simple redirection to Google Drive links.

➤ **Past Year Papers**  
Similar to the Notes section, this provides access to past year question papers through drive links.

➤ **LeetCode Questions**  
This section was originally added to experiment with dynamically loading content in Android apps. In the future, it can be improved or replaced with more useful resources such as branch-specific links, if contributors are interested.
